# Grafana Builder

This Docker image can be used to build Grafana stack, including NodeJS frontend and Golang backend.
It provides all the required Javascript and Golang tooling, as well as a pre-compiled version of Grafana.

It is based on the Redhat UBI images, specifically the [ubi8/go-toolset](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/go-toolset)
